## Abstract

Loss of coolant flow accidents (LOCA) is a type of failure event for a nuclear reactor,
generally initiated by either mechanical or electrical failure. The loss of coolant flow
in a nuclear reactor significantly decreases the heat removal performance of the core,
reactor core will be damaged and jeopardize tons of people. Detecting failure events
in nuclear power plants are always challenging since thousands of parameters are
required to keep tracking on. Therefore, forecast the accident through abnormal
parameters of the system is crucial for risk and safety analysis.

This study presents a deep learning-based method for fault diagnosis of a Reactor
Coolant System in nuclear power plant. With use of neural network model,
complicated parameters inside the reactor coolant system become readable for the
computer. Distinct events inside the system could understand as multi-class
classification problem by the computer.
